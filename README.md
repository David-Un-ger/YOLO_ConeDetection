# YOLO_ConeDetection
Create a traffic cone detector using Tensorflow 2

work in progress:
- dataset is cleaned up
- visualization and training works
- still some issues with finding the ideal loss function


Next steps:
- apply transfer learning on 8x8 grid images and just use objectness as loss function
- apply it on 16x16 grid
- further specify the loss function
